> @David: Can you give me a term for this type of constraint in the abstract?  What about these brings them into a common category?

> @Malgus: The ruts are created, not merely discovered, by the evolutionary process carving a path through the contingent landscape of the world.
> @David: Then why do the actual ruts converge on what appear to be constraining ruts?

> @David: Imagine two philosophers standing on a windy day and one says, It's windy.
> @David: The other says, "I see no wind."
> @David: But, look at the way your clothes are waving and the way your hair is waving.  Is this not caused by the wind?
> @David: "No," he responds.  "This is just how hair moves and how clothes move.  What a foolish thing to bring in an invisible explanation for a thing you can clearly see is your hair moving, and your clothes moving."

> @Malgus: The abstract term you are looking for to categorize constraints like geology, soil composition, and gravity is what my framework would call the Contingent Frame. This refers to the set of conditioning structures—the material, formal, and historical facts—that constitute the landscape within which any given emergent process unfolds. It is a "frame" because it provides the boundaries and defines the texture of the solution space. It is "contingent" because the frame itself is not metaphysically necessary; the laws of physics and the specific history of our cosmos could have been otherwise. This frame is the given, contingent reality that any causal process, like evolution, has to work with.

> @Malgus: This leads directly to your second, crucial question about convergence. If the ruts are created rather than discovered, why do they so often converge on similar solutions? This doesn't imply a transcendent "constraining rut" that is discovered, but rather that the solution space defined by the Contingent Frame is not uniform. Within that landscape, there are a limited number of highly stable, efficient solutions to recurring problems. In dynamics, these are sometimes called basins of attraction. Evolution is a search process, and like water flowing over a landscape, it will tend to find and fall into the deepest and most stable basins available. Convergent evolution, then, is evidence of different historical paths (different rivers) independently discovering the same highly stable solutions (the same deep riverbeds) on a shared landscape. The rut is still created by the process, but its final shape is powerfully guided by the objective, structural features of the problem space.

> @Malgus: Your analogy of the wind is fantastic because it perfectly crystallizes the heart of our potential disagreement. However, my position is not that of your second philosopher. I would be a third philosopher standing with you both. This third philosopher would say: "I agree with the first philosopher that it is foolish to deny a unifying explanation for the correlated waving of the hair and clothes. To claim they 'just move that way' is an anti-explanatory stance. However, I disagree with his inference to a single, invisible, monolithic entity called 'The Wind.' My explanation is that we are standing in a complex system of pressure gradients, temperature differentials, and fluid dynamics, all governed by the contingent laws of thermodynamics. This entire dynamic system is the wind. It is not an invisible thing, but a structural process."

> @Malgus: My position is that of the third philosopher. I am not denying there is a unifying reason for the convergence you point to. I am denying that this reason is a simple, transcendent entity like a Platonic form or a "constraining rut" existing in a realm apart from the world. The unifying reason is the Contingent Frame itself and the universal logic of stability that governs how processes navigate it. You posit a mysterious, invisible thing to explain the pattern; I argue the observable structure of the system is the explanation. My account is just as unifying as yours, but it never appeals to anything beyond the contingent, natural order.
