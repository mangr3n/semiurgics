## Prerequisite Mathematics

Below is a concise list of mathematical areas you should be comfortable with before diving into category theory.  We can iterate on this list to ensure it is comprehensive.

- Set theory (basic operations, Cartesian products, power sets, functions, relations)
- Logic and proof techniques (direct, contrapositive, contradiction, induction)
- Abstract algebra
  - Groups and group homomorphisms
  - Rings, fields, and ring homomorphisms
  - Modules and vector spaces
- Linear algebra (vector spaces, linear maps, matrices, dual spaces)
- Order theory (partially ordered sets, lattices)
- Topology (open/closed sets, continuous maps, basic examples)
- Basic graph theory (graphs, morphisms between graphs)
- Basic number theory (optional but helpful for concrete examples)

Feel free to suggest additions, removals, or restructurings of this list to make it definitive.
