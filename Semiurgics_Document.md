# Semiurgics: A Discipline of Extracting Implicate Meaning

## Definition

**Semiurgics** is the systematic discipline concerned with the extraction, formalization, and reasoning over the implicate models, categories, and presuppositions embedded in symbolic statements. It extends intuition and refines reasoning by making implicit structures explicit.

**Semiurgy** is the implicit action of understanding, deriving, and reasoning about the world specifically through language. Unlike linguistics, which analyzes the structure and function of language itself, semiurgy is an application of semiotics (and semiosis)—the action of signs in the world—focused on how an interpreter reflects upon and draws out the specific interpretation that is present within their own mind. Semiurgy concerns how meaning is actively constructed and revealed in the interpreter, not merely how language is used or structured.

## Relationship to Semiurgy

- **Semiurgy** is the implicit human craft of working with meaning and signs.
- **Semiurgics** is the explicit methodology that exposes and refines the structures within semiurgy.
- Semiurgics does not replace intuition but enhances it—clarifying and extending the habitus of reason embedded in intuitive judgments.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Categories
- Every term signifies a category.
- A category consists of:
  - A set of **Properties**.
  - A set of **Instances**.
- Categories can be nested, intersected, and abstracted.

### 2. Properties
Properties are organizing constraints or features that define and differentiate categories. Types include:
- **Observable**: directly perceivable (e.g. color, mass).
- **Implicate**: required by behaviors or relations, but not directly seen (e.g. agency).
- **Causal**: express how change happens or under what conditions state transitions occur.

### 3. Behaviors and Transformations
- Describes changes or actions performed by or upon entities.
- Entails causal structure, intention, and conditionality.

### 4. Causality, Change, and Choice
- Human action reveals preference through chosen behavior.
- Known side-effects not objected to are implicatively accepted.
- Regret arises when actual known effects are valued less than expected ones.

## Methodology

### Step 1: Presupposition Probing
Ask: *What must be true for this statement to be meaningful?*
- Extract underlying axioms, domain assumptions, causal claims.
- E.g. Mises: "Human action is purposeful behavior" presupposes that:
  - Humans are agentic.
  - Action is goal-directed.
  - Goals are semiosically encoded—meaning they are represented and acted upon through signs (icons, indices, symbols) within the organism. In humans, due to our semiotic nature, these goals can become available for introspection and articulation. Semiurgy is the implicit, often unconscious, process by which meaning is produced and goals are formed; semiurgics is the explicit, reflective process of making these structures available for conscious reasoning. For example, an animal may seek water and assess its safety semiosically—through instinct and direct perceptual cues—without engaging in explicit symbolic reasoning. In contrast, a human being can also act semiosically, but within the experience is present the mental elements of perception (concepts) and the capacity to symbolically represent those concepts. This allows the human to investigate and deepen their understanding of water—considering its properties, its relationship to the human being, and the broader context within which the human finds themselves.

### Step 2: Semantic-Frame Decomposition
Parse a sentence into:
- Agent
- Predicate/Action
- Patient/Target
- Goal/End
- Instrument/Means
- Context/Environment

### Step 3: Causal-Role Labeling
- Identify causal relations (e.g. X enables Y, X causes Z)
- Build graphs of causality for analysis and simulation.

### Step 4: Domain-Source Annotation
- Tag each presupposition with its disciplinary origin (e.g. economics vs. psychology).
- This reveals “bleed” between disciplines where assumptions cross unnoticed.

### Step 5: Graph Assembly
- Construct a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) of concepts and dependencies.
- Nodes = presuppositions, categories, causal links.
- Edges = logical, causal, or typological dependencies.

## Example: Mises on Human Action
- Category: Human
  - Defined by capacity for purposeful, semiotic action.
- Presupposition: Human action implies goal-oriented behavior.
- Economic framing: Human defined *primarily* as economic actor.
- Psychological framing: Human defined by internal mental states, not economic function.
- Result: Discipline-specific models surface through semiurgic analysis.

## Formal Tools
- Category definitions
- Property types
- Behavior models
- Resource-driven action models
- Dormancy and recovery dynamics
- Context-sensitive prioritization

## Purpose of Semiurgics
- To make the rational structure of intuition visible.
- To support clearer thought, better model translation, and more meaningful discourse.
