# Systematizing Claims and Non-Physical Systems - Plan

## Current Stage: Initial Exploration (PLAN)

### 1. Mathematical Foundation
- Investigate existing mathematical frameworks for claims representation
- Explore graph theory for claim relationships
- Research formal logic systems
- Consider type theory for claim categorization

### 2. Indicator Development
- Identify key dimensions for system measurement
- Develop mathematical indicators for abstract properties
- Create a taxonomy of system characteristics
- Define measurement scales and units

### 3. Modeling Language
- Build upon the rudimentary semiurgic pseudo language described in `Semiurgics_Document.md` as the foundation for formalizing relationships among claims, systems, and meanings.
- Iteratively move between semiurgic analysis (extracting and clarifying meaning, presuppositions, and structures) and refining the semiurgic tool(s) within this formalized language.
- Define and formalize syntax and semantics as the language matures.
- Develop abstraction levels for different types of systems and relationships.
- Establish consistency rules and validation mechanisms.

### 4. Philosophical Analysis
- Explore implications of systematization
- Consider epistemological aspects
- Analyze ontological questions
- Evaluate ethical considerations

## Next Steps
1. Begin literature review on mathematical foundations
2. Create initial mathematical framework
3. Develop first set of indicators
4. Start modeling language design

## Dependencies
- None identified yet (early stage)
