# Enduring Realism: Beyond the Modern Epistemological Impasse

## The False Dichotomy of Modernity

Modern philosophy, beginning with Descartes, has presented us with a false dichotomy regarding our knowledge of reality:

1. **Naive Realism**: The belief that our mental content is directly identical to reality itself
2. **Skepticism/Idealism**: The belief that our mental content has no reliable connection to external reality

This dichotomy has forced modern thought to oscillate between two equally problematic positions:

- **Materialist Reductionism**: Leading to the absurdity of a meaningless universe where mind itself is illusory
- **Idealist Solipsism**: Leading to a Gnostic-like isolation where each mind is trapped in its own universe

## The Forgotten Middle: Mature Realism

The realism that modernity rejects is primarily a naive realism, which it is right to be skeptical of. However, modernity fails to recognize that:

> The fact that mental phenomena are not identical to the thing-in-itself is not equivalent to claiming they are "not conformed to" the thing-in-itself.

The mature realist position holds that:

1. **Conformity without Identity**: Mental content can genuinely conform to reality while remaining distinct from it
2. **Proportional Knowledge**: Our sensations, perceptions, and conceptions are conformed to things-in-themselves in ways that are proportional and reliable, though fallible
3. **Mediated but Faithful**: Knowledge can be mediated without being distorted

## The Aristotelian-Thomistic Alternative

This mature realism has historical precedent in the Aristotelian-Thomistic tradition:

- Knowledge as the "formal identity" between knower and known while maintaining material distinction
- The intellect as "becoming all things" without ceasing to be itself
- Knowledge as an immaterial reception of forms that exist materially in reality

## The Modern Impasse

Modernity struggles to realize this mature realism because:

1. It collapses all realism into naive realism
2. It assumes that because perception involves mediation, it must be unreliable
3. It demands a kind of apodictic certainty that genuine knowledge doesn't require, while using examples of a lack of apodictic certainty in some phenomena to justify both a lack of apodictic certainty in all knowledge, and question the possibility of genuine knowledge at all.
4. It forgets that fallibility is compatible with reliability

## Epistemological Sleight-of-Hand

Modern epistemology frequently employs a form of philosophical sleight-of-hand that works by:

1. Establishing a criterion appropriate for a specific domain
2. Subtly extending this criterion beyond its proper scope
3. Using the inevitable failures to meet this misapplied criterion as evidence against knowledge itself

A prime example is the principle of falsifiability:

- **Initial Claim**: "All scientific theories must be falsifiable" (Popper's demarcation criterion for science)
- **Sleight-of-Hand**: This becomes extended to "all knowledge is falsifiable" or "unfalsifiable claims cannot count as knowledge"
- **Problem**: This extended claim is patently untrue, as many forms of knowledge (logical truths, mathematical proofs, first principles, etc.) are not falsifiable by design. Additionally, even in the case of scientific theories, the fact that they can be falsified doesn't mean "will be falsified". In fact, once an experiment predicted by a theory has been demonstrated to succeed in confirming that theory, that experiment will in fact ALWAYS PRODUCE THE SAME RESULT.

### The Misunderstanding of Scientific Progress

A critical misunderstanding about scientific knowledge stems from popular distortions of Popper's falsifiability criterion:

1. **What Popper Actually Said**: Scientific theories must be *in principle* falsifiable as a demarcation criterion
2. **Popular Distortion**: "All scientific knowledge is temporary and will eventually be falsified"
3. **Further Distortion**: "Scientific truth is always changing, therefore uncertain"
4. **Nihilistic Conclusion**: "Therefore we can't really know anything with confidence"

This distortion ignores how science actually progresses. For a new theory to supersede an older theory, it must:
- Account for all the successful experimental predictions of the previous theory
- Demonstrate superior explanatory and predictive capacity in some domain

The new theory does not "falsify" the old theory so much as demonstrate its superior scope. Einstein's relativity didn't make Newton's laws "false" - it showed their domain of applicability while extending beyond their limitations.

**Successful experimental results are permanent** - they don't become "false" when theories change. This crucial fact is often overlooked in popular discussions of science and knowledge.

This pattern repeats across modern epistemology:

- Scientific standards of empirical verification demanded for metaphysical claims
- Historical contingency used to undermine necessary truths
- Linguistic or cultural relativity leveraged against universal claims

Each time, a standard that is appropriate within one domain (science, history, linguistics) is inappropriately applied to another domain, setting up knowledge claims to fail by design. This contrasts sharply with the Aristotelian approach, which recognized that "it is the mark of an educated mind to expect that amount of exactness in each kind which the nature of the particular subject admits."

### The Nihilistic Brew

Modern materialism has concocted what could be called a "witch's brew" of epistemological skepticism by juxtaposing:

- Popper's falsifiability criterion (misunderstood)
- The fallibility of human perception
- Imprecision in measurement
- GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorem (often misapplied outside mathematics)

This brew is then used to attack not just naive realism (a legitimate target) but all forms of realist epistemology, undermining any faith in knowledge itself.

When this epistemological skepticism is combined with mind-body dualism, the result is profoundly nihilistic: an isolated mind whose knowledge is suspect and whose desires for truth, beauty, and goodness must be seen as mere evolutionary tricks or divine deceptions.

## Knowledge as Grip: Mature Realism in Action

To understand mature realism, we might consider knowledge as "grip" - the way the form of a thing discloses itself to us in its proportions, and in the manner appropriate to us as knowers. Unlike direct identity with the thing known, grip involves a proportional and reliable (though fallible) conformity to reality.

### The Cat in the Blurry Image

Consider an experience of looking at a slightly blurry image:

1. Initially, the mind searches for patterns, proposing various interpretations: "Perhaps it's a street scene... or a village pub interior..."

2. Suddenly, the proportionality of form unveils itself - "It's a cat!" The mind achieves grip on the form present in the image.

What happens in this moment of recognition?

- The form was present in the image all along
- The mind actively engaged with the sensory data, testing interpretations
- Knowledge occurred when the mind successfully conformed to the form
- This recognition wasn't arbitrary projection but genuine insight

This illustrates how knowledge can be mediated (through images, sensory apparatus), fallible (initial interpretations were incorrect), yet still involve genuine conformity to reality.

### A Meta-Analogy for Philosophical Blindness

This example serves as a powerful meta-analogy for our philosophical situation:

- The modern mind, committed to either materialist or idealist frameworks, is like someone who has settled on seeing the pub in the blurry image
- Once committed to that interpretation, seeing the cat becomes extraordinarily difficult
- The form of mature realism is "there" in philosophical reflection, but rendered invisible by prior commitments
- The materialist cannot see past material causes; the idealist cannot see past mental constructs

Just as recognizing the cat requires a certain openness and attentiveness to form, recognizing mature realism requires a willingness to transcend the false dichotomies of modern epistemology. The blindness to mature realism is not primarily intellectual but perceptual - a failure to "see" what becomes obvious once grasped.

This helps explain why presenting arguments for mature realism often fails to persuade: we are not merely offering propositions but inviting a perceptual shift - a new way of seeing the relationship between mind and world.

### The Confidence of True Knowledge

There's a deeper implication to this perceptual analogy that speaks to the robustness of true knowledge:

If the image truly is of a cat, then we can trust that viewing it differently will not ultimately destroy the perception of the cat. We can hear another interpretation ("it's a pub"), and even temporarily view the image through that alternative lens, trusting that if the cat image is in fact the proper interpretation, it will re-emerge as the superior interpretation upon careful consideration.

This illustrates a key feature of mature realism: confidence without dogmatism. The person who has truly "gripped" reality through knowledge can:

- Remain open to alternative interpretations
- Temporarily adopt different perspectives as an exercise
- Trust that truth will reassert itself through continued engagement

Unlike the fragile certainty of dogmatism (which cannot bear alternative views) or the indifference of relativism (which sees all interpretations as equally valid), mature realism offers a robust confidence that truth, once glimpsed, can be found again even after entertaining alternatives.

This has profound implications for philosophical dialogue. The mature realist can engage with materialist and idealist frameworks without fear of losing their grip on reality - confident that the proportional conformity between mind and world that constitutes knowledge will reassert itself when these alternatives ultimately prove inadequate.

## Science's Circular Foundation

The belief in reliable and reproducible experiments, the hallmark of scientific inquiry, itself depends on metaphysical commitments about reality that cannot be scientifically proven. In other words, the reliability of science is itself a circularly reinforced justified true belief.

For science to function, we must assume:

- The uniformity of nature (that natural laws operate consistently across time and space)
- The reliability of sense perception (mediated through instruments)
- The existence of a mind-independent reality
- The intelligibility of this reality to human minds

None of these assumptions can be proven by scientific experimentation without circular reasoning, as any experiment to verify them would already presuppose them.

This is not a weakness but a recognition of what science actually is: not a self-sufficient edifice floating free of metaphysical commitments, but a particular method of knowledge grounded in realist assumptions about the world and our capacity to know it.

The mature realist acknowledges this circularity without embarrassment. Rather than seeing it as a fatal flaw in scientific knowledge, it recognizes it as evidence that even our most rigorous empirical methods ultimately rest on a form of realism that cannot be reduced to pure materialism or idealism.

## Godel's Insight: The Nature of Foundations

It then integrates Godel's insight into logic and reason, that if causes and reasons always refer, at some point referring must ground in some terminus, and the questions of why or what stop. Circularity is one mechanism, pushes that infinite regress into a system which is finite in scope, BUT we consider it to be somehow insufficient. However, the "turtles all the way down" regress which is not circular, leaves us with another problem, what is sufficiently self-evident that it brooks no next "Why?", or no next "What?"

However, that "self-evidence" is a self-referential circularity on its face. We have misinterpreted Godel's insight as doubting the capacity for a foundation, instead of describing the features of a foundation.

Modern attempts to ground science without metaphysical commitments invariably fail, leading either to:

- Unacknowledged smuggling of realist assumptions into supposedly pure empiricism
- Self-defeating anti-realism that undermines the very practice of science it claims to explain

Mature realism offers a framework where these foundational commitments can be recognized honestly without undermining the genuine knowledge science provides.

## Consequences of the Modern Error

The rejection of mature realism has led to:

- Mind-body dualism that cannot be coherently resolved
- The tension between idealism and materialism that terminates in sophistic metaphysics
- An absurdist interpretation of reality that either exalts mind at the expense of world or world at the expense of mind
- A "will to power" approach to truth where reality conforms to our wishes rather than our minds conforming to reality

## Recovering Mature Realism

The path forward requires:

- Recognizing the distinction between identity and conformity in knowledge
- Accepting proportional knowledge as genuine knowledge
- Acknowledging human cognitive limitations without surrendering to skepticism
- Recovering a unified understanding of the human person as neither purely material nor dualistically divided

## Appendix: Philosophical and Scientific "Isms"

Below is a categorized reference of major philosophical and scientific positions that have shaped modern thought. Understanding these positions helps clarify where enduring realism stands in relation to other frameworks.

### Epistemological Positions (Theories of Knowledge)

- **Rationalism**: Knowledge primarily derives from reason and deduction rather than sensory experience (Descartes, Leibniz, Spinoza)
- **Empiricism**: Knowledge primarily derives from sensory experience (Locke, Hume, Berkeley)

- **Compatibilism**: Determinism is compatible with moral responsibility and free will

### Philosophical Dead Ends (Results of Anti-Realist Thinking)

- **Nihilism**: Rejection of all meaningful aspects of existence (moral, epistemological, existential); fundamentally an error of Telos (purpose/final cause in Aristotelian terms) that inevitably leads to an absurd conception of reality
- **Absurdism**: (1) Human tendency to seek meaning in a meaningless universe creates an absurd condition (Camus); (2) Any theory of reality that leads to absurd, contradictory, or self-defeating conclusions
- **Solipsism**: Only one's own mind can be known to exist; external world and other minds cannot be known
