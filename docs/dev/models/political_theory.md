# Political Theory

## Purpose
This document serves as the foundational model for developing a fundamental Theory of Politics. It will be refined through systematic investigation, drawing from common descriptions and philosophical traditions to distill core principles and purposes of political theory.

## Colloquial Definition
Politics, in its broadest sense, is the activity and process by which groups of people make collective decisions, organize governance, and manage power relations. It encompasses the ways in which communities are structured, how resources and values are allocated, and how differing interests are reconciled through debate, negotiation, and the exercise of authority.

### Common Themes
- Governance and organization of communities
  - **Governance:** The processes (motion), structures (forms), and traditions (principles) through which authority is exercised and decisions are made for a group or society.
  - **Organization:** The arrangement and coordination of people, roles, and resources—through processes (motion), structures (forms), and traditions (principles)—to achieve collective goals or maintain order within a group.
  - **Community:** A group of individuals who share a sense of belonging, common interests, or identity, and who interact within a shared social structure or environment, shaped by processes (motion), structures (forms), and traditions (principles).
  - *Note: Across these definitions, the common thread is the orientation toward decisions, goals, and interests as central to political activity.*
- Distribution and exercise of power
  - **Power:** Formally, power is the capacity to effect change or produce work. In physics, work is defined as motion (or the application of force) toward a goal or outcome. In social contexts, power is the ability to influence, direct, or coordinate the actions of others to achieve shared or individual objectives.
  - **Work:** Work, in this context, is purposeful motion—action directed toward a goal. In living systems, work is always oriented toward sustaining, changing, or achieving something of value.
  - **Social Action:** Social action is the coordinated work of individuals within a community. It involves aligning efforts, resources, and intentions—whether in harmony or conflict—to pursue common interests or goals. Even the simplest social action (between two people) is a form of ordered cooperation or contest over shared concerns.
- Decision-making and allocation of resources/values
- Reconciliation of differing interests
- Public deliberation and collective action

## Core Principles

### 1. Metaphysical Foundations of Political Necessity

Politics emerges from fundamental metaphysical constraints that create the conditions for both conflict and cooperation. These constraints aren't contingent but necessary features of reality.

```haskell
-- The fundamental metaphysical conditions that necessitate politics
data MetaphysicalConstraint =
    ExclusivityOfForm   -- Matter cannot simultaneously actualize multiple competing forms
  | ExclusivityOfSpace  -- A single location cannot contain multiple distinct entities
  | ScarcityOfPotency   -- Matter has only determinate potencies, not infinite possibilities
  | PluralityOfAgents   -- Multiple independent wills exist with their own ends
  | TemporalFinitude    -- Time and resources for actualization are limited
```

### 2. Human Agency and Material Reality

Humans as political beings are characterized by their agency in relation to material constraints.

```haskell
-- The nature of human agency in relation to material reality
data HumanAgent = HumanAgent
  { agency :: Will              -- Independent capacity to choose ends
  , intellect :: Intellect      -- Capacity to grasp forms and possibilities
  , needs :: [MaterialNeed]     -- Requirements for biological and social flourishing
  }

-- Communication emerges from agency and intellect through signification
data Communication = Communication
  { signification :: Intellect -> Will -> Signal -- Creation of meaningful signals
  , interpretation :: Signal -> Intellect -> Meaning -- Reception of signals
  , coordination :: [HumanAgent] -> Communication -> Maybe CoordinatedAction
  }

-- The emergence of social interaction from fundamental capacities
socialCapacity :: HumanAgent -> HumanAgent -> Communication
socialCapacity agent1 agent2 = 
  Communication
    { signification = \i w -> expressForm i w
    , interpretation = \s i -> graspMeaning s i
    , coordination = \agents comm -> 
        if all canSignify agents && all canInterpret agents
        then Just (establishCommonAction agents)
        else Nothing -- No coordination possible without communication
    }

-- The nature of material reality in relation to human agency
data MaterialReality = MaterialReality
  { resources :: [Resource]     -- Matter with determinate potencies
  , space :: [Location]        -- Places with distinct properties and capacities
  , temporality :: Time         -- Finite duration for actualizations
  }
```

### 3. The Political Problem

From these conditions emerges what we might call the "political problem" - the challenge of coordinating independent agents in relation to scarce resources with exclusive actualizations.

```haskell
-- The fundamental political problem
data PoliticalProblem = PoliticalProblem
  { agents :: [HumanAgent]                         -- Multiple beings with agency
  , resources :: [Resource]                        -- Scarce resources with determinate potency
  , competingActualizations :: [Agent -> Resource -> Maybe Form]  -- Different possible forms for the same matter
  , exclusivityConstraint :: Resource -> Bool      -- One resource cannot have multiple forms simultaneously
  }

-- The necessity of politics
necessitatesPolity :: PoliticalProblem -> Bool
necessitatesPolity problem =
  (length (agents problem) > 1) &&                 -- Multiple agents exist
  (any isLimited (resources problem)) &&           -- Resources are limited
  (any hasCompetingActualizations (resources problem)) -- Multiple desired actualizations exist
```

### 4. Conflict and Cooperation as Responses

Given these conditions, both conflict and cooperation become possible responses to the political problem.

```haskell
-- Fundamental modes of political interaction
data PoliticalInteraction =
    Conflict                       -- Competition for exclusive actualization rights
  | Cooperation                     -- Coordination to maximize actualizations
  | MixedStrategy [PoliticalInteraction] -- Combination of multiple interaction types

-- Conditions for each interaction type
isConflict :: [HumanAgent] -> Resource -> Bool
isConflict agents resource =
  -- Multiple agents want incompatible actualizations of the same resource
  length (competingActualizations agents resource) > 1

isCooperation :: [HumanAgent] -> [Resource] -> Bool
isCooperation agents resources =
  -- Coordination produces more value than individual action
  value (coordinate agents resources) > sum (map value (individualActions agents resources))
```

### 5. Politics as Preventive Insight and Conventional Coordination

Politics proper begins not with theoretical conflict resolution itself, but with the fundamental insight that communication can be used to avoid brute conflict. It then develops through the establishment of shared conventions that minimize cognitive load in recurring conflict scenarios.

```haskell
-- The progression from conflict to political coordination
data PoliticalDevelopment =
    BruteConflict       -- Direct competition through force
  | PreventiveInsight   -- Recognition that communication can prevent conflict
  | SharedConventions   -- Adoption of common norms for recurring scenarios
  | InstitutionalOrder  -- Formalized systems for maintaining conventions

-- Politics proper begins with the preventive insight
isPolitical :: PoliticalDevelopment -> Bool
isPolitical BruteConflict = False      -- Not yet politics, merely animal competition
isPolitical PreventiveInsight = True   -- Politics begins with this insight
isPolitical SharedConventions = True   -- Politics develops through conventions
isPolitical InstitutionalOrder = True  -- Politics matures in institutions

-- The role of conventions in transforming possibilities
data Convention = Convention
  { scenario :: ConflictScenario      -- A recurring situation of potential conflict
  , pattern :: CoordinationPattern    -- An agreed response pattern
  , expectation :: ExpectationField   -- What others can be expected to do
  , cognitiveEconomy :: CognitiveLoad -- Reduction in decision-making burden
  , possibilityTransformation :: PossibilitySpace -> PossibilitySpace -- Qualitative expansion of what's possible
  }

-- Conventions don't just incrementally improve but qualitatively transform possibilities
transformativePower :: Convention -> OrderOfMagnitude
transformativePower convention =
  let
    withoutConvention = measurePossibilities (scenario convention) NoConvention
    withConvention = measurePossibilities (scenario convention) (pattern convention)
  in
    withConvention / withoutConvention  -- Often an order-of-magnitude difference (10x or more)
    
-- The univocity of conventions is key to their acceptance despite restricting freedom
data ConventionLegitimacy = ConventionLegitimacy
  { univocity :: UnivocalApplication     -- Applied equally to all participants
  , restriction :: FreedomRestriction    -- Limits on individual choice
  , acceptance :: PublicAcceptance       -- Degree of voluntary compliance
  }

-- The relationship between univocity and acceptance
conventionAcceptance :: Convention -> PublicAcceptance
conventionAcceptance convention =
  if isUnivocal convention
  then highAcceptance                     -- Universal application leads to high acceptance
  else lowAcceptance                      -- Unequal application leads to resistance

-- Univocity as fairness in restriction
isUnivocal :: Convention -> Bool
isUnivocal convention =
  forAllAgents $ \agent ->
    appliesEqually convention agent &&     -- Same rules for everyone
    restrictsSimilarly convention agent    -- Similar restrictions on freedom

-- Example: Traffic conventions transform possibility space
trafficConvention :: Convention
trafficConvention = Convention
  { scenario = sharedRoadwayUsage
  , pattern = driveOnSpecifiedSide
  , expectation = otherDriversFollowSamePattern
  , cognitiveEconomy = loweredAttentionRequirement
  , possibilityTransformation = \before -> 
      -- Without convention: ~5-10mph maximum safe speed
      -- With convention: ~70mph maximum safe speed (7-14x increase)
      transformSpeedPossibility before (Factor 10) &&
      transformSafetyPossibility before (Factor 100) &&
      transformAttentionAllocation before byReducingBaselineVigilance
  }

-- Political forms as responses to the political problem
data PoliticalForm =
  PoliticalForm
  { distributesActualizationRights :: Resource -> [HumanAgent] -> Distribution
  , resolvesDivergenteEnds :: [End] -> Process -> Maybe End
  , coordinatesCollectiveAction :: [HumanAgent] -> [Action] -> CollectiveAction
  }

-- Politics exists because of these metaphysical conditions
needForPolitics :: [HumanAgent] -> [Resource] -> Bool
needForPolitics agents resources =
  (length agents > 1) &&                      -- Multiple agents with intellect and agency
  canCommunicate agents &&                    -- Capacity for signification exists
  canRecognizePreventiveValue agents &&       -- Can recognize communication prevents conflict
  (any (\r -> exclusivityOfActualization r)  -- Resources that cannot have multiple actualizations
        resources) &&
  (any (\r -> length (desiredBy agents r) > 1) -- Multiple agents desire the same resources
        resources) &&
  (hasRecurringScenarios agents resources)    -- Scenarios occur with enough frequency to justify conventions
```
