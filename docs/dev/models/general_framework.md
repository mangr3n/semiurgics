# General Framework for Claim Systematization

## 1. Foundational Structure

### 1.1 Claim Space Representation

We represent the claim space using the following mathematical structures:

- **Universe of Discourse** ($U$): The complete set of all entities, concepts, and relationships relevant to the domain
- **Claim Set** ($C$): The set of all claims in the domain
- **Actor Set** ($A$): The set of all actors who can make claims
- **Evidence Set** ($E$): The set of all evidence that can support or contradict claims

### 1.2 Claim Formalization

Each claim $c \in C$ can be represented as a tuple:

$$c = (P, R, V, T, A_c, E_c)$$

Where:
- $P$ = set of premises (entities involved)
- $R$ = relation type (functional mapping between premises)
- $V$ = truth value assignment (can be binary, probabilistic, fuzzy, etc.)
- $T$ = temporal scope (when the claim is applicable)
- $A_c$ = actor making the claim
- $E_c$ = evidence supporting the claim

## 2. Relation Types

We can classify relations ($R$) into several categories:

- **Causal Relations**: $X \rightarrow Y$ (X causes Y)
- **Correlational Relations**: $X \sim Y$ (X correlates with Y)
- **Compositional Relations**: $X \subset Y$ (X is part of Y)
- **Equivalence Relations**: $X \equiv Y$ (X is equivalent to Y)
- **Ordering Relations**: $X > Y$ (X is greater than Y)

## 3. Truth Value Systems

Different domains may require different truth value systems:

- **Binary Logic**: $V \in \{0, 1\}$
- **Probabilistic Logic**: $V \in [0, 1]$
- **Fuzzy Logic**: $V \in [0, 1]$ with specific membership functions
- **Modal Logic**: Necessity, possibility operators
- **Temporal Logic**: Time-dependent truth values

## 4. Claim Networks

Claims can be organized into networks where:

- Nodes represent individual claims
- Edges represent relationships between claims (supports, contradicts, extends)
- The network can be analyzed for consistency, coherence, and completeness

### 4.1 Network Properties

- **Consistency**: No contradictory claims ($\nexists c_i, c_j \in C$ where $c_i \Rightarrow \neg c_j$)
- **Coherence**: Claims form a connected structure
- **Completeness**: Coverage of the relevant domain

## 5. Measurement Indicators

For non-physical systems, we can define abstract indicators:

- **Claim Strength**: $S(c) = f(E_c, V)$ - function of evidence and truth value
- **Network Density**: $D(C) = \frac{|\text{actual edges}|}{|\text{possible edges}|}$
- **Consensus Measure**: $M(c, A) = \frac{|\{a \in A | a \text{ accepts } c\}|}{|A|}$
- **Resilience**: Ability of the claim network to maintain consistency when challenged

## 6. Application Process

1. **Domain Identification**: Define the universe of discourse
2. **Claim Extraction**: Identify core claims from domain literature
3. **Formalization**: Represent claims in mathematical notation
4. **Network Construction**: Establish relationships between claims
5. **Analysis**: Evaluate consistency, coherence, completeness
6. **Refinement**: Iterate and improve the model

## 7. Example Application: Austrian Economics

See [Austrian Economics Model](austrian_economics.md) for a detailed example of this framework applied to economic axioms.
