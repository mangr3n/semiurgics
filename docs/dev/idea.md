# Project Vision: Systematizing Claims and Non-Physical Systems

## Overview
This project investigates how meaning, reasoning, and interpretation are formalized—focusing on the structures underlying claims and the systems they constitute. The goal is to develop a rigorous framework for describing and analyzing complex systems of meaning, reasoning, and interpretation.

Central to this project is the distinction between semiosis (the process by which signs produce meaning), semiotics (the study of sign processes), and semiurgy—the implicit, lived discipline of meaning-making that operates within every semiotic being. Semiurgics is the formal discipline concerned with training, refining, and developing this semiotic capacity. Its purpose is to cultivate the habitus of semiotics within individuals, enabling their semiurgy to grow in capacity and effectiveness as they engage with increasingly complex systems of meaning and reasoning.

## Key Questions
1. How can we mathematically represent claims and their relationships?
2. What indicators can we use to quantify and measure non-physical systems?
3. How can we create a modeling language for abstract systems?
4. What are the philosophical implications of systematizing claims?

## Expected Outcomes
- A formal mathematical framework for claims representation
- A set of standardized indicators for system analysis
- A modeling language for physical and non-physical systems
- Philosophical insights into systematization

## Constraints
- Focus on theoretical exploration
- Emphasis on mathematical rigor
- Consider philosophical implications
- Maintain practical applicability
