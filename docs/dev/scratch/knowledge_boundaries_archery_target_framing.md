# Framing Scratch: Knowledge Boundaries — Archery Target Model

This is a working pad to clarify the problem, stakes, terms, and thesis before editing the target document.
When items below are settled, we will migrate the pertinent content into `../models/knowledge_boundaries_archery_target.md`.

---

## Critique of current opener (TLDR)

- __Too solution-first__: Jumps to thresholds/ε/rings before stating the problem.
- __Problem not framed__: No one-sentence articulation of the epistemic tension being resolved.
- __Stakes & audience unclear__: Does not say who needs this model or why it matters now.
- __Metaphor unmotivated__: Archery target appears without explaining why this geometry is apt vs. alternatives.
- __Jargon density__: Probability notation and policy language overload the opener.
- __Undefined terms / definition debt__: Minimal scopes needed up front. Specifically:
  - Thresholds (understood)
  - ε (epsilon tolerance) needs a plain-language definition and example
  - "Rings" need metaphor vs. formal framing
- __No anchor example__: Lacks a concrete case that previews the pay-off.
- __Scope/non-goals missing__: No statement of what the paper will explicitly not claim.

---

## Definition Debt

- List of terms that need plain-language definitions and examples:
  - Threshold(s): decision cut(s) and deferral zone
  - ε (epsilon tolerance): per-decision tolerated risk
  - Rings: metaphor vs. formal framing
  - Scope qualifier: where a claim applies (domain, conditions, horizon)
  - Nines / horizon: reliability target, aggregation across decisions/time, error budgets
  - Scope signature: minimal tuple to evaluate truth (domain, conditions, horizon, quantification)
  - Generics/Habituals: how general statements (“It rains”) encode reliability within scope
  - Orders of truth: ordo essendi (order of being) vs ordo cognoscendi (order of knowing)
  - Logos: constraint/source of ontological certainty; proportionality as constitutive of being
  - Order drift: confusing claims about being with claims about knowing (and vice versa)
  - Scope drift: moving domain/conditions/horizon/quantification mid-argument
  - Quantifier shift: sliding from “exists/usually” to “always/never” (or reversing)
  - Motte‑and‑Bailey of certainty: retreating to weak scope while arguing with strong rhetoric
  - Operational bounds: Planck length/time as measurement/channel limits vs ontological discreteness
  - Minimum Resolvable Region (MRR): smallest credible/usable region given scope, reliability target, and operational limits
  - Region‑of‑Acceptance R(ε): set of states/actions acceptable given thresholds/ε and nines across the horizon
  - Bullseye thickness: resolution‑limited thickness of inner acceptable region; shrinks with information, bounded below
  - Center as limit: ideal point (measure‑zero) approached by nested regions; not directly observable

## Personal Framing Inputs

- What are the core motivations and concerns driving this work?
- What are the key questions or problems that need to be addressed?

---

## Core Problem Narrative

- What is the central problem or tension that this model aims to resolve?
- How does this problem relate to the key terms and concepts?

---

## Scope-Bound Certainty (language as shorthand)

- Absolute-sounding statements (“is,” “certain,” “always”) often function as shorthand for very high reliability within a declared scope, not metaphysical absolutes.
- The scope must be explicit: domain, conditions, and horizon over which the reliability holds (the “nines”).
- Fuzziness is mitigated in two ways:
  - Structural interior: evidence places us clearly inside a ring; the boundary band is far away.
  - Boundary-general: claims are broad enough to live at the outer ring of possible realities, acknowledging residual ambiguity.
- Guidance: couple strong language with scope qualifiers and reliability targets; reserve absolutes for regulative ideals, not achieved states.

---

## Relevance Realization (Vervaeke): Shock scales with broken nines

- The agent experiences salience/shock when a highly reliable (many‑nines) compressed assumption fails in context.
- The more “nines” implicitly attributed to a belief, the stronger the shock when evidence contradicts it; policies/thresholds are then revised.
- In rings: large shock corresponds to a jump from deep interior to boundary/outside; expect escalation, re‑calibration, and possible scope repair.

---

## Structural Semantics: Ellipsis and Default Scope

- Ordinary language is elliptical: every assertion omits details listeners supply from context.
- Truth is evaluated against an implicit __scope signature__: (domain, conditions, horizon, quantification).
- Strong-sounding claims compress high reliability within that scope; not absolutes without scope.
- Bounding examples:
  - False by scope: “It rains on the surface of the Sun” (outside domain → outside ring).
  - True by scope: “On Earth, somewhere, at least once in any 100‑year period over the last million years, it rains” (broad scope + long horizon → many nines inside ring).
- Repair rule: when ambiguity is high (boundary), request/offer scope qualifiers; otherwise defer or broaden evidence.

---

## Two Orders of Truth: Ontology (logos) vs Epistemology (scope)

- __Order of being (ordo essendi)__: Logos grounds ontological certainty by constraining what can be. This is the constitutive resolution of reality into form (Truth as mode of harmony).
- __Order of knowing (ordo cognoscendi)__: Our knowledge is finite, mediated, and scoped—captured by thresholds, ε, and nines. We approximate/logos by adaequatio (conformity) and resonance, never exhaustively.
- __Reconciliation__: Absolute truth belongs to being-as-logos; human certainty is scope-bound reliability approaching that order to varying degrees.
- Cross-refs:
  - `../models/ontology_of_relations.md`: reality of relations; proportional structure; fallible apprehension.
  - `../models/theory_of_intelligibility.md`: intelligibility constitutive of being; constraints making reality knowable.
  - `../models/theory_of_harmony.md`: truth/goodness/beauty as modes of harmony; proportionality (logos) as bridge.

---

## Finitude of Resolution in Relations (error endemic to knowing)

- __Resolution is bounded__: Every informing channel has finite capacity; thus every relational apprehension has limited resolution. This boundedness yields “something rather than nothing/everything.”
- __Error/indeterminacy endemic__: Not in being per se, but in knowing/conforming/resonating. Chaos/indeterminacy are possible in our grasp even when ontology is constrained by logos.
- __Life as demonstration__: Practice shows perfect knowledge is not achievable; we operate by thresholds and repair cycles.
- __Rings mapping__: Logos fixes the overall target geometry; our evidential position moves within it. The apophatic band persists as structural boundary.

---

## Reframing “Absolute vs Relative Truth”

- __Not relativism__: Scope-bound reliability is not “anything goes”; scopes are disciplined by ontological constraints and calibration.
- __Not naïve absolutism__: Human assertions without scope pretend to share the certainty of logos; they don’t. Make scope explicit.
- __Synthesis__: Ontological absolutes (logos-level constraints) + epistemic reliabilities (nines within scope). Certainty in knowledge = degree of conformity to being within declared scope.

---
## Center‑as‑Point, Bullseye‑as‑Region (MRR)

- __Perfection as point__: The true “center” is a measure‑zero ideal (ordo essendi). In knowing (ordo cognoscendi), it’s only a limit of shrinking neighborhoods; it has no width to be seen.
- __Bullseye as region__: Our best operational object is a __Minimum Resolvable Region (MRR)__: the smallest set that simultaneously (a) meets the reliability target (nines) over the horizon, (b) respects operational resolution/noise, and (c) satisfies decision thresholds and ε.
- __Thickness__: The bullseye has real thickness equal to the diameter of the MRR. It can shrink with information but is bounded below by operational limits (cf. Planck‑scale note) and residual model error.
- __Decision semantics__:
  - “On target/bullseye” = evidence places us inside MRR with margin ≥ safety buffer.
  - “Boundary” = MRR intersects a ring boundary → escalate/measure/repair.
  - “Outside” = MRR disjoint from interior → reject/alternate policy.
- __Accuracy vs precision__: Precision ≈ diameter(MRR). Accuracy ≈ offset of MRR relative to the true center/rings. Calibration ties claimed nines to actual coverage of MRR.
- __Transitions via MRR__:
  - Inconceivable → conceivable: R(ε) first intersects feasible set under model constraints.
  - Plausible → probable: majority of mass/evidence concentrates so that MRR lies mostly within interior ring.
  - Probable → inevitable (functional): alternatives outside MRR fall below ε across the horizon; MRR sits deep interior.
- __Language mapping__: Replace “exactly at the center” with “within tolerance τ, inside MRR with ≥ [nines].” The “center” functions as a regulative limit, not an observable object.

---

## Epistemic Phase Transitions: thresholds of visibility, discriminability, actionability

- __Analogy__: Like water “freezing” at a boundary, knowledge exhibits threshold behavior when an instrument or idea crosses a practical limit.
- __Three thresholds__
  - __Visibility__: resolution/SNR becomes sufficient to detect phenomena at scale/time/contrast H_v.
  - __Discriminability__: features become separable; categories stabilize; false conflations drop.
  - __Actionability__: intervention policies become viable with ε below budget across the horizon.
- __Microscopy case__
  - Pre‑threshold: microbes below visibility horizon → many claims live in outer rings; MRR is large; pathogen mechanics inconceivable or speculative.
  - Post‑threshold: microscopes lift H_v → feasible set expands; R(ε) and MRR intersect new interiors; new generative models for life/processes appear.
  - Result: refined rings, thinner bullseye (smaller MRR), and new classes of interventions; also, new error modes (sampling artifacts, model illusions, iatrogenic effects).
- __Archery mapping__
  - Boundaries shift inward as discriminability improves; some “unknown unknowns” become “known unknowns,” then “knowns.”
  - Phase‑like: detection probability crosses decision cut; a continuous improvement produces a categorical policy switch (freeze at boundary → interior).
  - Bullseye dynamics: initial thickening (over‑confidence/novel errors), followed by thinning via calibration and error‑budgeting.
- __Policy loop__: detect → escalate → recalibrate thresholds/ε and error budgets → redeploy.
- __Caution__: Instrument‑lift expands scope but also introduces blind spots and side effects; log “model debt” and track iatrogenic/measurement error explicitly.

---

## Implications: Error, Accuracy, Certainty

- __Error (knowing)__
  - Endemic to bounded resolution; manifests when MRR intersects/crosses ring boundaries.
  - Budgeted: decompose into measurement, model, and intervention (iatrogenic) error; allocate ε across sources.
  - Surprise ∝ broken nines; triggers policy review and threshold recalibration.
  - Instrument‑lift reduces some errors but adds instrument/observer effects; track as model debt.
- __Accuracy (closeness to center)__
  - Bias/offset: distance between MRR centroid and true center/rings; reduce by calibration and invariance checks.
  - Coverage vs claim: observed frequency inside R(ε) should match stated nines; miscalibration revealed by reliability diagrams.
  - Drift detection: when invariance fails under fixed scope, re‑estimate, or revisit scope.
- __Certainty (scope‑bound reliability)__
  - Degree of certainty = nines within declared scope; not metaphysical absolutes.
  - Functional inevitability: alternatives outside MRR fall below ε across horizon; policy‑level “must.”
  - Language gates: map “always/never” to many‑nines within scope; declare scope to prevent order/scope drift.
- __Practice protocol__
  - Freeze order and scope; declare MRR and R(ε); set thresholds/ε and error budget; calibrate; monitor drift; escalate on boundary.

---

## Reverse‑Engineering the Bait‑and‑Switch (Order vs Scope)

- __Diagnostic taxonomy__
  - __Order drift__: Treating limits of knowing as limits of being, or inferring ontological instability from epistemic error.
  - __Scope drift__: Changing domain/conditions/horizon/quantification (scope signature) mid‑argument without notice.
  - __Quantifier shift__: Trading “exists/usually” for “always/never” (and back) to win a move.
  - __Reliability conflation__: Interpreting many‑nines shorthand as metaphysical absolutes, or reading denial of absolutes as denial of reliability.
  - __Motte‑and‑Bailey of certainty__: Defend a modest, scoped claim; attack with universal rhetoric.
  - __Frame reset__: Resetting default scope (ellipsis) to force contradiction.

- __Detection tests__
  - __Order test__: “Is this about what is (logos, essendi) or about our grasp (policy, cognoscendi)?” Freeze the order.
  - __Scope signature test__: Demand domain, conditions, horizon, quantification. Freeze the scope.
  - __Invariance test__: With scope fixed, does the truth value hold under allowed perturbations? If not, adjust quantifier.
  - __Calibration test__: What nines? Show orthogonal evidence and error budget.
  - __Reparability test__: If scope clarification repairs disagreement, it was epistemic, not ontological.
  - __No‑scope‑shift rule__: No mid‑argument scope changes without explicit restart.

- __Repair protocol__ (diagnose → restate → decide)
  1) Pin order (being vs knowing) and scope signature; restate the claim accordingly.
  2) Set thresholds/ε and escalation paths; mark boundary cases for deferral.
  3) Add orthogonal evidence; document commitments and allowed scope changes.

- __Planck‑scale note (operational vs ontological)__
  - Planck length/time provide current theoretical bounds on measurement and channel capacity; they exemplify bounded resolution in knowing.
  - They do not, by themselves, entail ontological discreteness. Treat them as operational constraints; ontological claims require additional argument.

---

## Micro‑Lexicon and Claim Templates

- “X is true” → “Within [scope signature], X holds with ≥ [nines] reliability; boundary cases handled by [deferral/escalation].”
- “Always/Never” → “Across horizon H, with ≥ [nines] reliability within scope S.”
- “Impossible” → “Outside ring under model constraints; would require scope change or violation of constraints.”
- “Ambiguous/Undecided” → “Boundary zone; request scope or gather orthogonal evidence.”
- “Exact” → “Within tolerance τ below operational resolution; treat ‘exact’ as a limit concept (center as unobservable point).”
- “On target/Bullseye” → “Inside MRR with margin ≥ safety buffer; boundary cases deferred or escalated.”
- “Precision” → “Diameter of MRR; decreases with information; bounded below by operational limits.”
- “Inevitable (functional)” → “Alternatives outside MRR below ε across horizon; state deep interior relative to boundaries.”
 - “Phase transition (epistemic)” → “A threshold crossing (visibility/discriminability/actionability) that triggers a categorical policy/model update.”
 - “Visibility horizon H_v” → “Scale/time/contrast beyond which detection probability falls below the target nines.”
 - “Instrument‑lift” → “An expansion of visibility/scope; expect new error modes and required recalibration.”
 - “Iatrogenic/Instrument error” → “Error introduced by the intervention/instrument; add to error budget and thresholds.”
 - “Model debt” → “Accumulated mismatch after scope lift; must be paid down via calibration and evidence.”
 - “Calibration” → “Adjusting model/measurement so predicted nines match observed coverage; validated by reliability curves.”
 - “Coverage” → “Empirical fraction of outcomes inside predicted R(ε); compare against claimed nines.”
 - “Error budget” → “Allocation of allowable error across sources (measurement/model/intervention) to meet ε.”
 - “Safety buffer” → “Margin from MRR to nearest boundary to guard against drift/variance.”

## Default‑Scope Heuristics

- If scope isn’t stated, assume everyday human domain, ordinary conditions, near‑term horizon, and high‑but‑finite reliability.
- On challenge or high stakes, surface scope signature explicitly and tighten nines/thresholds.
